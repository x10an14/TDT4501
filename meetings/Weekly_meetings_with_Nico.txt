Weekly meetings with Nico:

Until further notice: Weekly meetings at Wednesday 1100.

14th Jan, 2015:
	Kick out:
		Building a supercompiler
		Optimizing generics is easy
		Bigloo compiler
			Not so relevant.
		Losing functions without Gaining Data

	No extensions on paper; hard deadline end of May.

	Short high-level summaries of papers in the read papers list.
	Think shortened abstract.
		Re-do the ones already written.

	Problemsetting comes before introduction.
		Write problem setting inside introduciton
		Add problemset (/"assignment") pdf from Nico in the appendix

	Start writing background into paper as its own section, after introduction
		Write about the RVSDG!!! (In this section, its own subsections)

	Basic architecture of an inliner
		How to take care of recursive functions
		Inline recursive function until a certain depth.
		Or use the GHC strongly component strategy

	Need to decide which properties to use to decide when to inline the recursive
functions.

	Jive compiler:
		Phi region/block is the one entails each  mutually recursive binding
groups.
		Phi is a mutually recursive environment
		Lambda is a function
		Gamma is conditional
		Theta is loop construct

	Related work preferably finished end of january
	Backrgound preferably finished by middle of february

	Remove personal stuff from report. Keep only what should stay in the final
version of the report.


	Code:
		First look at the recursive functions
			Return which lambdas you can inline and which you cannot
		Those you can inline: move onto the architecture.
		Inline literal, class
		abstract function bool performInline(Apply node) = 0;


	Relevant:
		Should potential loop optimizations
		Region based compilation has section with references to relevant papers
			Section 3: references 3 & 4! (Not alot relevant in the rest of the
paper, but a little bit here and there.)
		Static Unrolling Recursion to Improve Opportunities for Parallelism
		Adaptive compilations and inlining
		Rest of papers: all interesting

Next to read:
	Adaptive compilation to read next



7th Jan, 2015:
	Read: Skim through book on programming languages, parts of Nico's master
thesis
	Read more papers.
	Write background into related work.

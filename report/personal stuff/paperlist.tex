\begin{itemize}

	\item ``\textbf{Should potential loop optimizations influence inlining
decisions?}'', by Christopher Barton and Jos√© Nelson Amaral and Bob Blainey, at
University of Alberta and IBM Toronto Software Laboratory, Canada. \\
\textit{Perhaps 2nd most interesting at this moment?}\\
\url{http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=961329}

	\item ``\textbf{Region-based compilation: an introduction and motivation}'',
\\ byRichard E. Hank and Wen-Mei W. Hwu, at University of Illinois, and B.
Ramakrishna Rau, at Hewlett Packard Laboratories, Palo Alto California. \\
\textit{3rd most interesting on this list at the moment.} \\
\url{http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=225160.225189&coll=DL&dl=ACM&CFID=470941312&CFTOKEN=25125832}

	\item ``\textbf{Statically Unrolling Recursion to Improve Opportunities for
Parallelism}'', \\by Neil Deshpande and Stephen A. Edwards, at Columbia
University NY. \\
\textit{This one sounds cool, and being static is a plus. But that's all its got
going for it without having read it more closely. It does discuss inlining.}\\
\url{http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~sedwards/papers/deshpande2012statically.pdf}

	\item ``\textbf{An adaptive strategy for inline substitution}'', \\ by Keith
D. Cooper and Timothy J. Harvey and Todd Waterman, at Rice University Houston
and Texas Instruments Inc. Stafford, Texas. \\
\textit{Perhaps most interesting at this time due to discussing global/static
optimizations as well as being relatively new compared to other papers in this
list?}\\
\url{http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1788381}

	\item ``\textbf{Adaptive compilation and inlining}'', \\ by Todd Waterman
and Keith D. Cooper, at Rice University Houston Texas. \\
\textit{Not sure if this is what Nico wants me to find, but this is a paper
discussing aspects of inlining I don't think I've considered much in earlier
paper searches.}\\
\url{http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1195126}

	\item ``\textbf{Practical and effective higher-order optimizations}'', \\ by
Lars Bergstrom and Matthew Fluet and Matthew Le and John Reppy and Nora Sandler,
at Mozilla Research CA and Rochester Institute of Technology NY and University
of Chicago IL. \\
\textit{This paper discusses inlining as well as some other optimizations.
Picked for citing GHC-paper, and being from 2014, more than much else.
I'm not sure I completely understand the abstract, but I got the feeling the
paper might have an interesting take on inlining.} \\
\url{http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2628153}

	\item ``\textbf{Demand-driven Inlining Heuristics in a Region-based
Optimizing Compiler for ILP Architectures*}'', \\ by Tom Way and Ben Breech and
Wei Du and Lori Pollock, at University of Delaware USA. \\
\textit{This paper discusses a region-based compiling technique and how to
utilize inlining in conjunction with this, while focusing on optimizations for
ILP architectures. Picked paper for mentioning inlining in Keywords and
abstract, as well as also dealing with region based compilation which seems
relatable to Jive.} \\

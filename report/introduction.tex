\section{Introduction}

Since the 1950s, compilers have played an important role in the way programming
code is translated into machine languages. In broad terms, compilers perform two
things; The translation of human-readable code to machine language, and
optimizing the translated programs. One such optimization is inlining.

Inlining is a straight-forward optimization, which replaces the call of a
function with its body. Its benefits include removal of function call overhead
and unveiling of additional optimizations. The drawbacks are potential code
duplication, work duplication, as well as longer execution times for the
compilation of the program. Not all functions are straight-forward to inline,
recursive functions being part of this subset.

This paper details the inliner for the new compiler backend,
Jive\footnote{Detailed in Section \ref{background:jive}.}, the decisions made
for its architecture, and \todo{Maybe to vague? Figure out how to make it less
ambiguous/sound better.}evaluates its performance. Jive takes code in
intermediate representation (IR) as input and works on a new IR representation,
the regionalized value-state dependency graph (RVSDG\footnote{Detailed in
Section \ref{background:RVSDG}.}).

We will also discuss how the decision of which functions to inline (inlining
heuristics) is made by the inliner and how these decisions can be
influenced/changed. Further details of the assignment of this paper can be found
in Appendix \ref{app:projdesc}. \\

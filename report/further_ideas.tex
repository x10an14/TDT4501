\section{Further ideas}

\subsection{Dynamic profiling and adaptive compilation}
\todo[inline]{Basically re-iterate Waterman's PhD idea.}

\subsection{Choosing loop breakers more carefully}
\todo[inline]{Bas' MSc. idea}

\subsection{The ordering of which call sites to order first}
\todo[inline]{Lots to say on ordering of call sites to be inlined}

\subsubsection{Something} todo[inline]{If time permits, I want to briefly
discuss the idea of evaluating all the apply nodes (in order), before inlining
any. So as to be able to see the total cost of inlining a successive chain of
function calls in one direction or the other.}

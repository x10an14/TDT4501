\section{Further Work}
\label{sec:further_work}

\subsection{Dynamic profiling and adaptive compilation}
\todo[inline]{Basically re-iterate Waterman's PhD idea.}

\subsection{Choosing loop breakers more carefully}
\todo[inline]{Bas' MSc. idea}

\subsection{The ordering of which call sites to order first}
\label{further_work:call_site_visit_order}
\todo[inline]{Lots to say on ordering of call sites to be inlined}

\subsubsection{Something}
\todo[inline]{If time permits, I want to briefly discuss the idea of evaluating
all the apply nodes (in order), before inlining any. So as to be able to see the
total cost of inlining a successive chain of function calls in one direction or
the other.}
